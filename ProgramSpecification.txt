Here is the specification
The game has 3 states
- ATTRACT: attract if no game is runing, currently called bg_on, please rename this mode to ATTRACT
- GAME_RUN: running game - no effect is triggered or currently running
- EFFECT_ACTIVE: running game - effect is triggered with according led animation
      simple effects like setting a color to red, green blue etc. stays for 2 seconds, please ensure for simple effects that they stay for 2 seconds
	  complex effects are blocking and run as long as it takes
	  
in GAME_RUN state I want the led stripe to constantly show a 128,128,128 color
please implement those states with a state machine


The program starts in ATTRACT mode
The program shows the attract color 5 seconds then changes it.
it cycles through each attract color exactly once in random order before repeating
those are the attract colors green, blue, red

can you please modify the programm accordingly


can you please assign according the following description for each J126(x) the according effects listed under each J126(x) event
Please write the pogram so that everytime the J126(x) is triggred an effect is dynamically choosen from the according J126(x) list. 
Each effect is used once until each effect for each J126(x) is unsed once
Please assign dynmaically and randomly the following colors to the dynamcially chosen effect: red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, purple, white, orange, lime, sky, mint, magenta, lavender 
until each color is used once then start using them again
Please leave the other parameters as provided in the specification, just replace the colors. The colors are the string parameter values in ""
