Here is the specification
The game has 3 states
- S1: attract if no game is runing
- S2: running game - no effect triggered
- S3: running game - effect is triggered with according led animation
      simple effects like setting a color to red, green blue etc. stays for 2 seconds
	  complex effects are blocking and run as long as it takes
	  
in S2 I want the led stripe to constantly show a 128,128,128 color

The program starts in Attact mode
The program shows the attract color 3 seconds then changes it.
it cycles through each attract color exactly once in random order before repeating
those are the attract colors
dark green, light green, dark blue, light blue, purple, please represent the colors for the pinduino library in rgb values

can you please add according the following description for each J126(x) the according effects listed under each J126(x) event
Pleaese randomly choose one effect. Each effect is used once until each effect for each J126(x) is unsed once
Please assign randomly the following colors: red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, purple, white, orange, lime, sky, mint, magenta, lavender 
until each color is used once then start using them again
