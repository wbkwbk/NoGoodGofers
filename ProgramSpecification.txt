Here is the specification
The game has the following meta states with substates intended
State Machine
	Red Button connected to D6
	Blue Button connected to D7
	We have the following meta states:
	NO_LED	//all LEDS are off
	ALL_LED	//Full LED Features available according the following indented substates
		With substates
			ATTRACT //When the game is not running
					//The program shows the attract color 5 seconds then changes it.
					//it cycles through each attract color exactly once in random order before repeating
					//those are the attract colors green, blue, red
			GAME_RUN //Game is runnuing but no effect is active - LED color is set to the one chosen by SET_STATICCOLOR or if not set to the default  first one in the list: "white"
			EFFECT_ACTIVE //effect is trigered by J126(x), with according led animation
					simple effects like setting a color to red, green blue etc. stays for 2 seconds, please ensure for simple effects that they stay for 2 seconds
					complex effects (J126(10), J126(9), J126(7)) are blocking and run as long as it takes		
	ALL_LED_RUN_ONLY - only static playfield lightning
		With substate
			GAME_RUN - only static playfield lightning
	SET_BRIGHTNESS	- set the global Brightness for all Modes where LEDs are on
	SET_STATICCOLOR	- set the color for ALL_LED_RUN_ONLY, GAME_RUN

	The program starts in NO_LED mode
		
Complex Effect selection
	can you please assign according the following description for each J126(x) the according effects listed under each J126(x) event
	Please write the pogram so that everytime the J126(x) is triggred an effect is dynamically choosen from the according J126(x) list. 
	Each effect is used once until each effect for each J126(x) is unsed once
	Please assign dynmaically and randomly the following colors to the dynamcially chosen effect: red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, purple, white, orange, lime, sky, mint, magenta, lavender 
	until each color is used once then start using them again
	Please leave the other parameters as provided in the specification, just replace the colors. The colors are the string parameter values in ""

	J126(10)
		1. nggPinduno.adrLED1()->bullet2Color(color1, color2, 20, 2, 1); // Blocking
		2. nggPinduno.adrLED1()->bulletFromPoint2Color(color1, color2, 17, 5, 17);//Blocking
		3. nggPinduno.adrLED1()->color(color1);
		3. nggPinduno.adrLED1()->spreadOutToPoint(0, 1600);//Blocking
		nggPinduno.adrLED1()->spreadInFromPoint2Color(1, color1, color2, 1000); //Blocking

	J126(9)) {
		  nggPinduno.adrLED1()->bullet2Color("color1", color2red", 20, 2, 1); // Blocking
		  nggPinduno.adrLED1()->dataStreamNoTail2Color("color1", "color2", 20, 20, 1);
		  nggPinduno.adrLED1()->spreadInFromPoint2Color (1, "color1", "color2", 500); 
	J126(7)
		nggPinduno.adrLED1()->rainbowWS2812FX(1); 
		nggPinduno.adrLED1()->rainbowCycleWS2812FX(1)  
		nggPinduno.adrLED1()->spreadInFromPoint2Color(1, color1, color2, 1000);

Simple Effect color selection
	Please assign a random color from the list staticColors the the following simple effects. Please use each color once until each is used.
	Please maintain a seperate list to track the colors used for Simple Effects.
		J126(12)
		J126(11)
		J126(6)
		J126(5)
		J126(4)
	
Button Events
	Please enhance the following program by this specification:
	The current states remain as they are the new states have to be incorperated correctly to the existing states. They are like a layer above the existing states.
	There are two simple press buttons to be observed. Their status is: Pressed/Not Pressed. Those are the hardware buttons: ttps://www.bastelgarage.ch/m5stack-mini-dual-button-unit?search=m5stack%20mini%20dual%20button%20unit
	Button connection to Arduino Nano	
		Red Button connected to D6
		Blue Button connected to D7
		We have the following meta states:
			as described in the chapter State Machine above
		
		
	Per default, when the program starts, the Game State is NO_LED which means game is not in  ATTRACT, GAME_RUN, EFFECT_ACTIVE state. 
		NO_LED means the led stripe is off - dark
	The following Events must be handled properly
		1. Red Button Pressed toggles Game States between meta state NO_LED/ALL_LED
			ALL_LED means the game can enter all states ATTRACT, GAME_RUN, EFFECT_ACTIVE
			NO_LED means game cannot enter any of those states ATTRACT, GAME_RUN, EFFECT_ACTIVE,  the led stripe is off - dark
		2. Blue Button pressed
			If the blue button is pressed and the game is in state ALL_LED this button toggles between
				- ALL_LED -> game can enter all states ATTRACT, GAME_RUN, EFFECT_ACTIVE 
				- ALL_LED_RUN_ONLY -> game will immediatley enter GAME_RUN state where the LED will be light with the color selected in state SET_STATICCOLOR
			IF the game  is in state NO_LED please see 5. SET_STATICCOLOR
		3. Blue button long pressed, longer then one second game enters in state	
			SET_BRIGHTNESS
				when entering SET_BRIGHTNESS state the led strip color is set to red
				a counter starts after one second, the counter variable is called brightness. 
				The counter is incremented every 50ms until 255 is reached, then it starts again at one.
				Every time the counter is increased the brightness of the LED stripe is set to the according brightness value
				This continues until the button is released again. The current value is then saved.
				When the  button is released the games goes back to it's previous state
				When brightness value of 200 is reached blink one time in color green: 1 second on 200ms off, block other code execution during blink, then continue with SET_BRIGHTNESS
				When brightness value of 230 is reached blink 2 times in color green: 1 second on, 200ms offblock other code execution during this period, then continue with SET_BRIGHTNESS
				When brightness value of 255 is reached blink 3 times in green, 1 second on, 200ms off, then turn on leds for 3 seconds in green block other code execution during this period,, then continue with SET_BRIGHTNESS  
				
		4. Red Button double click - two clicks within one second when NOT in state SET_STATICCOLOR:
			The game immediately goes to ALL_LED state, the brightness is set to 255 and the color the one selected in SET_STATICCOLOR
			
		5. SET_STATICCOLOR: When system is in meta-state NO_LED and the blue button (D7) is pressed: The system changes to New meta_state SET_STATICCOLOR
			Red Button Single Click: Cycle through a predefined list of colors ({"white", "red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "cyan", "purple", "orange", "lime", "sky", "mint", "magenta", "lavender"}), starting with the first entry (white). At the end of the list, restart with white.
				Selected Color Usage: The chosen color becomes the static color for:
					-	The ALL_LED_RUN_ONLY meta-state (applied in the GAME_RUN state).
					-	The ALL_LED meta-state when in the GAME_RUN state (but not in ATTRACT or EFFECT_ACTIVE, which retain their existing behavior).

			Blue button click in the state SET_STATICCOLOR:  Exits the meta-state SET_STATICCOLOR and returns to the previous meta-state before the transition to SET_STATICCOLOR
			Red button double click in state SET_STATICCOLOR: resets the color list index and sets it the the first color
